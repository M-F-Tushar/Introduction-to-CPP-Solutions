ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s happening?
sizeof(int) gives the size of an int, usually 4 bytes.

So sizeof(int) is 4.

BUTâ€¦ here's the tricky part:

sizeof doesn't give a normal number. It gives an unsigned number â€” that means it can never be negative.

-1 is a negative number, but when it's compared to something unsigned, it gets converted into a huge positive number (like 4 billion!).
